1.4.71
Modifying the yes/no logic: readline requires the exact prompt
(from readline version 8.1)

1.4.7
Handle yes/no answers by readline (need to hit enter) - corrected
bugfix: save command without arguments give double free()

1.4.6
add conversion commands "ext" and "nat" to convert an expression
to I-measures, and natural coordinates, respectively. Tidy up
some help text, mainly using one space indent.

1.4.5
allow curly braces {} to group entropy terms; change some
documentation.

1.4.4
allow additional information measures entered as
  (a,b,c,d), or just (a,b,c,d|x)
(simple style) or
  I(A;B;C;D)  or I(A;B;C;D|X)
(full style) to be defined as
  -\sum { (-1)^|A| H(AX): A is a subset of abcd }
new parameter:
  measure = yes/no (allow the above information measure shorthand)
add "a << b" as a new form of functional dependency
change the term "zap" to "unroll"

1.4.3
complain if '-c <file>' used but the <file> is not found
allow == as offline argument
set cmdarg_position when in offline mode (bugfix)

1.4.2
changing the printout when the expression simplifies to 0=0
improved help (e.g., "save <file>")
the rc file is processed for non-interactive usage as well
additional command-line arguments:
   -m <macrodef> define this macro
   -c-           don't read .minitiprc
   -c <file>     init file replacing .minitiprc

1.4.1
additional run time parameters under "set"
  constrlimit  = maximal number of constraints
  macrolimit   = maximal number of macros
  run       = strict/loose: how to handle errors (continue with non-fatal errors)
  comment   = yes/no (print comments from run file)
  abbrev    = yes/no (allow abbreviated commands)
  save      = yes/no/ask (save history at exit)
  simplevar = basic/extended (allow letter plus digits in simple style)
  history   = default ".minitip" history file

additional command: save - save history

If .minitiprc found, it is executed as a run file. It is searched in
the working directory, then in the home directory.
